### Description:

#### Context
This dataset contains over 80,000 reports of UFO sightings over the last century.

#### Content  
There are two original versions of this dataset: scrubbed and complete. The complete data includes entries where the location of the sighting was not found or blank (0.8146%) or have an erroneous or blank time (8.0237%). Since the reports date back to the 20th century, some older data might be obscured. Data contains city, state, time, description, and duration of each sighting. There is a third file, `ufos.csv`, which contains UFO sighting information for only the United States and for which I've done a bit of data cleaning. You may find it useful to start with that one.

#### Inspiration  
What areas of the country are most likely to have UFO sightings?
Are there any trends in UFO sightings over time? Do they tend to be clustered or seasonal?
Do clusters of UFO sightings correlate with landmarks, such as airports or government research centers?
What are the most common UFO descriptions?
