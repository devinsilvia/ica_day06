#### Content:
This file contains general information about all hospitals that have been registered with Medicare, including their addresses, type of hospital, and ownership structure. It also contains information about the quality of each hospital, in the form of an overall rating (1-5, where 5 is the best possible rating & 1 is the worst), and whether the hospital scored above, same as, or below the national average for a variety of measures.

This data was updated by CMS on July 25, 2017. CMS' overall rating includes 60 of the 100 measures for which data is collected & reported on Hospital Compare website ([https://www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/search.html](https://www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/search.html)). Each of the measures have different collection/reporting dates, so it is impossible to specify exactly which time period this dataset covers.
